Portals is an attempt at a strict and somewhat faithful reproduction of the
portal behavior found in Minecraft Survival Single Player (SSP) for the Bukkit
mod plugin system, with some extensions. Portals are created with a direct
spatial mapping from normal world coordinates to Nether world coordinates.
Portals create a small air pocket and platform when first created. So, a portal
that is on solid ground in the normal world may create a portal in mid-air in
the nether, and a portal from the Nether may appear underwater in the normal
world. Portals will not create themselves in configurations which are otherwise
invalid in SSP, such as two portals directly face-to-face adjacent. Other valid
configurations may not appear, however no directly contradictory configuration
should appear.
